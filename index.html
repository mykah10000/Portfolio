            <p class="about">Hi! My name is Micah Luck, and Iâ€™m a second year computer science student at the University Of Cincinnati.  I have always loved computers since I was little, 
                I remember spending countless nights when I was 10 years old modding minecraft and setting up servers so that me and my friends could play together.
                That curiosity turned into a passion for problem solving and building things with code. Today I am working on building this website.</p>
            <p class="about">Outside of programming I have many different interests and influences.  I love staying active, running, playing basketball or soccer, and snowboarding whenever I can.
                I also have a huge interest and appreciation for music and art, always exploring different genres and creative styles.</p>
